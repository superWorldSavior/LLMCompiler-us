Conceptual Guide¶
This guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind the LangGraph framework and AI applications more broadly.

We recommend that you go through at least the Quick Start before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples — those are found in the Tutorials and How-to guides. For detailed reference material, please see the API reference.
